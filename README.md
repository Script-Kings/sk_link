<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9a1971-5219-41d2-a31e-8eef906f55c4" width="112">

This resource is designed to seamlessly link scripts with supported frameworks and dependencies, enabling any resource to integrate cleanly with the frameworks and external systems listed below.

This goes beyond simple compatibility. It provides a unified abstraction layer and a set of powerful helper utilities that streamline development, making it faster and easier to build, extend, and maintain new scripts.
